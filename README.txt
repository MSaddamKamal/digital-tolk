What I expect in your repo.

1, A readme with:   Your thoughts about the code. What makes it amazing code. Or what makes it ok code. Or what makes it terrible code. How would you have done it. Thoughts on formatting. Logic.. 

2.  Refactor it if you feel it needs refactoring. The more love you put into it. The easier for us to asses.  

Make two commits. First commit with original code. Second with your refactor so we can easily trace changes.
